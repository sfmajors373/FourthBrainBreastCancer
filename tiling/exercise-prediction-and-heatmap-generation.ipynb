The steps in this notebook can be broken down into:\n",

    "- Get slides with `Slidemanager.get_test_slides` \n",

    "\n",
    "Following the original CAMELYON16 challange, the task would now be, to predict CAMELYON16 test dataset. Back in 2016, the labels were not published to the public. The metrics to evaluate the model were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) at slide level and then calculate the are under the ROC curve (AUC).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) for lesion based evaluation. Briefly, this metric measures, how well the regions in a tumorus slide match the true regions. Also, for each coordinate in the metastatic region, a confidence score had to be submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in evaluating your model and see how it would have performed in the CAMELYON16 Challenge you can read more about the evaluation and the scoring at the [official CAMELYON16 website](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/Evaluation/)"

    "Instead we will head straight towards the CAMELYON17 challenge. The second goal of CAMELYON16 (lesion based) also prepares for this. From the confidence score it is straight forward to create a heatmap as prediction for a slide (similar to the tumor mask). These heatmaps can then be used to achieve the goals of the CAMELYON17 challenge, which are:\n",
    "- Predict if a slide contains no tumor regions, only isolated tumor cells (ITCs), micro metastasis of macro metastasis.\n",
    "- To be able to achieve this, the CAMELYON17 dataset is labeled with 4 different classes.\n",
