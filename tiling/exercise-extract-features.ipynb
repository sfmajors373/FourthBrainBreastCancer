    "This is the first of three notebooks about the CAMELYON17 challenge. In this challenge, the task is to predict a patients pN-stage (pN0, pn0(i+), pNmi, pN1 and pN2). The pN-stage is determined by the lables of the five slides corresponding to the patient. Once the lables of the individual slides are known (_negative, itc, micro, macro_), the patient's pN-stage can be looked up in a table (see the official [CAMELYON17 website](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Evaluation/)). So the real difficulty of the challenge is to predict the labels of the slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately the training data here is very limited as we have only 500 slides from the CAMELYON17 training set and 130 labled slides from the CAMELYON16 test set (labled with _negative, itc, micro, macro_). So opposed to the task of the CAMELYON16 challenged where we had thousands of tiles and only two different labels (_normal_ and _tumor_), we will not be able to supply another CNN model with sufficient data. Even worse, for the _itc_ class, we only have 35 examples in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, our approach is to make use of domain specific knowledge and extract geoemtrical features from the heatmaps, which can be used to train a less complex model, e.g, a decision tree.\n"

    "  - The model did not only use zoom level 2. Instead two CNNs were trained. One on level 0 and one on level 1.\n",
    "  - As a consequence of the higher zoom, they also have a higher resolution.\n",
    "  - The CNNs' architecture was a more sophisticated one, the Inception v4 architecture (for details see [[SZE17](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261)]).\n",
    "  - Algorithm for advanced (domain specific) color normalization was applied [[BEJ16]].\n",
